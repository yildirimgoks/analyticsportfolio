##### A look into English-speaking movies, award winner and nominees from 1934 to 2017 using data from IMDb, Kaggle and self-curation.
An exercise with a very fruitful and teaching preprocessing part. The multi-million row IMDb datasets, filtered and enhanced with webcrawling will probably inspire more analysis later on.
